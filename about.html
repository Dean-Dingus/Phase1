                        <h2>My General Background</h2>
                        <p>I was a computer science major in college. I went to a liberal arts college, so I got to experience a great wealth of academic
                            topics. As you may have seen on my home page, I pursued topics on religion and Russian culture
                            almost as fervently as I pursued computer topics.  <br/> <br/>

                            I was involved in a lot of artistic pursuits in my free time. Singing, theater, and satirical writing all gave me a creative outlet. 
                            None of them scratched my creative itch, so to speak. As I begin my career with TCS,
                            I hope that the technologies I learn here will give me a way to express myself creatively. <br/> <br />

                            By the way, this is not me in the picture. I hope it is not illegal to use the photo 
                            of a stranger in this project. I know that is poor form for a company project, 
                            but I consider this a personal project.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My Computer Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            I studied a lot of upper level computer science concepts in college. Computer vision, data mining, operating systems,
                            and programming language grammarss are all upper level courses that I took. My education taught
                            me *why* many things in the computer world work. I did not spend much time learning the syntax 
                            of many different programming languages, so I am grateful that TCS is giving me the opportunity
                            to learn so much before I join their workforce properly. <br/> <br />

                            I am most comfortable with Java, C, and Scala. I spent much time this summer learning C++, but there is still
                            much more to learn, I'm sure. I took a course on Javascript this summer, as well, but all of the learning through SimpliLearn has 
                            definitely built upon what I learned myself.
