There are four files on this blog site. home.html is the landing page, and all pages can be accessed from all other pages thanks to my nav bar.
The home page does not use very much bootstrap, but the other three html files all make good use of bootstrap. home.html mostly uses normal CSS techniques. 
I made the pages in the order of home, about, blog, and contact.
The bootstrap for about.html took a long time to figure out, but I could reuse that content more or less for blog and contact.
I added the js for the contact.html as an afterthought. The html input fields and "required" tags should cover everything, but the js validation gives my page a bit more security.
I own neither of the pictures used in this project, and I make no claim to be their owner. I do not want to get into copyright trouble.
I wrote the blogs myself, which I'm sure is obvious. I had fun writing them.
The TCS laptop cannot install git or even visit github.com. That was very problematic for this assignment, so I sent all of the files to my personal computer and uploaded them manually to my private GitHub account. I could not do the proper push/pull/branching git functions throughout
	this product's creation because of my company's limitations.
