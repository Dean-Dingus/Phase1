                                            In high school, I had a course for one trimester on HTML and CSS. For my final project,
                                            I made a whole website about solar power. I could choose any topic I could possibly want,
                                            and I chose solar energy. This suggests that I did not know myself very well at the age of 14.
                                            Alternatively, it means I had not really developed as a person by that age. I fear the latter
                                            it true. <br/> <br/>
                                            CSS was brutal for me to understand. There are so many options, which is fantastic for design.
                                            It is terrible for learning, because it means there is an initial steep learning curve.
                                            Once you get over that curve, I imagine CSS it thrilling to work with. While you're learning, though,
                                            the dependence of CSS values on each other (what can be applied where, what overrides what, etc)
                                            is overwhelming. To this day, I do not have a firm grasp on it. At least I am better equipped than
                                            I was three weeks ago.

                                            Did you know that different operating systems have different schedulers? Even more interesting,
                                            the same operating systems have different schedulers throughout their iterations.
                                            The Linux kernel v. 1.6 had a unique scheduler that was immediately abandoned in the next patch.
                                            Windows 10 has a different scheduler than Windows 8, but the default scheduler in Windows 10 has changed throughout its lifetime.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            The Linux kernel v. 1.6 had a few settings within its scheulder that users could tweak to change
                                            CPU performance. Although I would consider myself tech literate, it astounds me that there are people out there
                                            who tweak their operating system, their fundamental piece of computing power. They have such a great knowledge of something
                                            that it completely cryptic to most of the population.

                                            A final word of advice. If you ever go to the Pizza Bakery, do not order the Digestive Mantra tea.
                                            It is a laxative, but it is not advertised as such. I learned the hard way.
